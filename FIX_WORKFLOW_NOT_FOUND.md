# Fix: "Workflow was not found" Error

## Problem

GitHub Actions error:
```
workflow was not found
".github/workflows/deploy.yml"
-> "bengler9/github-actions-templates/.github/workflows/python-test.yml@main"
```

## Root Cause

GitHub Actions cannot access the workflows in `bengler9/github-actions-templates` repository. This is because EITHER:

1. ❌ The workflows haven't been pushed to GitHub yet, OR
2. ❌ The repository is private and calling repo doesn't have access

## Solution

### Step 1: Push Templates to GitHub (REQUIRED)

```bash
cd /Users/brianengler/Code/github-repos/github-actions-templates

# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Phase 1.5: Enhanced templates with full GitLab CI parity

- Added quality-checks.yml (flake8, mypy, cfn-lint)
- Added security-scans.yml (bandit, checkov, radon)
- Added code-analyzer.yml (git archive → S3)
- Added verify-docs.yml (markdownlint)
- Enhanced lambda-deploy.yml (pilot learnings)
- Enhanced python-test.yml (S3 uploads)
- Added upload-s3-report action
- Updated documentation and examples"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Verify Repository Visibility

Check if the repository is public:
1. Go to: https://github.com/bengler9/github-actions-templates
2. Look for "Public" or "Private" badge at the top

**If Private:**

You have 2 options:

#### Option A: Make Repository Public (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://github.com/bengler9/github-actions-templates/settings
2. Scroll to "Danger Zone"
3. Click "Change visibility"
4. Select "Make public"
5. Confirm

#### Option B: Configure Private Repository Access
1. Go to: https://github.com/bengler9/github-actions-templates/settings/actions
2. Under "Access", select "Accessible from repositories owned by user 'bengler9'"
3. Save

This allows all your repositories to use these templates.

### Step 3: Verify Workflows Exist on GitHub

Visit: https://github.com/bengler9/github-actions-templates/tree/main/.github/workflows

You should see:
- code-analyzer.yml
- lambda-deploy.yml
- python-test.yml
- quality-checks.yml
- security-scans.yml
- terraform-workflow.yml
- verify-docs.yml

If they're missing, the push didn't complete - retry Step 1.

### Step 4: Re-run the workflow

After fixing:
```bash
cd /Users/brianengler/Code/github-repos/github-e2-lambda

# Trigger workflow again (no code changes needed)
git commit --allow-empty -m "Re-trigger workflow after template push"
git push origin feature/test2
```

---

## Quick Diagnosis

Run these commands to check status:

```bash
# Check if templates are committed
cd /Users/brianengler/Code/github-repos/github-actions-templates
git status

# Check if local main is behind remote
git status -uno

# Push if needed
git push origin main
```

---

## Verification

After pushing, verify workflows are accessible:

Visit: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bengler9/github-actions-templates/main/.github/workflows/python-test.yml

- **If you see the workflow**: ✅ Templates are accessible
- **If you see 404**: ❌ Either not pushed or repository is private

---

## Most Likely Issue

The templates were committed locally but **not pushed to GitHub**.

**Solution**: Run Step 1 above to push them.

Once pushed, the `github-e2-lambda` workflow will be able to reference them!
